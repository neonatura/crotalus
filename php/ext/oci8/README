The OCI8 Extension
------------------

Use the OCI8 extension to access Oracle Database.

Documentation is at http://php.net/oci8

The extension can be linked with Oracle client libraries from Oracle
Database 10.2, 11, or 12.1.  These libraries are found in the database
installation, or in the free Oracle Instant Client available from
Oracle.

Oracle's standard cross-version connectivity applies.  For example,
PHP OCI8 linked with Instant Client 11.2 can connect to Oracle
Database 9.2 onward.  See Oracle's note "Oracle Client / Server
Interoperability Support" (ID 207303.1) for details.

PHP OCI8 2.0 can be built with PHP 5.2 onward.  Use the older PHP OCI8
1.4.10 when using PHP 4.3.9 through to PHP 5.1.x, or when only Oracle
Database 9.2 client libraries are available.
