Background History
==================

Crotalus is a genus of venomous pit vipers [found only in the Americas] derived from the Greek word krotalon, which means "rattle" or "castanet", and refers to the rattle on the end of the tail.

This package is based off of Boa, a high performance web server for 
Unix-alike computers, covered by the Gnu General Public License. 
Derived from boa version 0.94, released January 2000.  

Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips <paulp@go2net.com>.  It is now being
maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@boa.org>
and Jon Nelson <jnelson@boa.org>.
