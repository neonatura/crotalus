Purpose
=======

This is crotalus, a high performance web server for linux or windows computers. This project strives to combine the benefits of a highly stream-lined single-threaded web server and common HTTP standards such as SSL and inline PHP interpretting.

This package is being provided in order to make use of the web server provided with the libshare library suite (github.com/neonatura/share) without having to integrate into the libshare functionality; such as having to store the web server files to be hosted or executed in a sharefs partition.


Upcoming Features
=================

* 'default' directory support (retracts to parent dir [and so on] if url path doesnt exist)
* nanohttp feature support (including ssl, registered callbacks, and misc auth)
* inline PHP for files ending in ".php" and executable
* doxygen HTML & man-page documentation (incl. extended source commenting)
* win32/gnulib compatibility support
* 'make install' (support incl. /etc/rc.d/ sub-system & w/e ubuntu uses)


Performance Specifications
==========================

The crotalus webserver can handle executing more than a hundred cgi scripts per second, and is capable of much higher performance with static HTML pages. By comparison, a apache web server running a medium-sized PHP application can take up over 1000 processes to render over one million pages per day (11/sec). 

  Doc Note: A more 'apple to apple' comparison is needed here.

The secret behind it's high-performance is a single-threaded monolithic design with all focus going towards the web engine. This contrasts with common web servers, such as apache, which utilizes multiple processes or threads (based on config) in order to achieve high-volume web page serving and requires a much larger frame-work in order to accomodate common modules and standards. A real world comparison may be of the likes of a motorcycle compared to a freight truck. The freight truck will be able to deliver a much wider array of content, but when a lighter load is delivered the motorcycle will always be able to out-perform.

There are limits, though, to this model. Due to the monolithic (synchronous) nature of the web engine, each page rendered by cgi (php or otherwise) must be written in a manner (such as ajax) which ensures a small life-span. This is because each page is rendered before the next is handled. 

PHP Support
===========

As the web server is implemented consideration will be taken on whether splicing the PHP interpretter's stack to be handled as threads outside of the scope of the primary web engine. Another alternate that may be developed is a task engine which will intepret ongoing php interpretation at the same time new pages are being rendered. The consideration needed here is drifting too far from the engine's original model is counter-intuitive to the program's natural procedure flow.

No PHP support is currently provided.


Background History
==================

The latin term "crotalus" is a sub-specicies of highly venomous snakes including the rattlesnake.

This package is based off of Boa, a high performance web server for 
Unix-alike computers, covered by the Gnu General Public License. 
Derived from boa version 0.94, released January 2000.  

Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips <paulp@go2net.com>.  It is now being
maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@boa.org>
and Jon Nelson <jnelson@boa.org>.
