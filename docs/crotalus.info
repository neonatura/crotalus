1 Introduction
**************

Crotalus (Boa) is a single-tasking HTTP server.  That means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection,
nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections.
It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and
forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate processes),
automatic directory generation, and automatic file gunzipping.
Preliminary tests show Crotalus (Boa) is capable of handling several
thousand hits per second on a 300 MHz Pentium and dozens of hits per
second on a lowly 20 MHz 386/SX.

The primary design goals of Crotalus (Boa) are speed and security.
Security, in the sense of _can't be subverted by a malicious user,_ not
_fine grained access control and encrypted communications_.  Crotalus
(Boa) is not intended as a feature-packed server; if you want one of
those, check out WN (`http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/') from John Franks.
Modifications to Crotalus (Boa) that improve its speed, security,
robustness, and portability, are eagerly sought.  Other features may be
added if they can be achieved without hurting the primary goals.

Crotalus (Boa) was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips (<psp@well.com>).
It is now being maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle
(<ldoolitt@crotalus.org>) and Jon Nelson (<jnelson@crotalus.org>).
Please see the acknowledgment section for further details.

GNU/Linux is the development platform at the moment, other OS's are
known to work.  If you'd like to contribute to this effort, contact
Larry or Jon via e-mail.

2 Installation and Usage
************************

Crotalus (Boa) is currently being developed and tested on
GNU/Linux/i386.  The code is straightforward (more so than most other
servers), so it should run easily on most modern Unix-alike platforms.
Recent versions of Crotalus (Boa) worked fine on FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.4,
GNU/Linux-SPARC, and HP-UX 9.0.  Pre-1.2.0 GNU/Linux kernels may not
work because of deficient mmap() implementations.

File: crotalus.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Files Used by Crotalus (Boa),  Up: Installation and Usage

2.1 Installation
================

  1. Unpack
       1. Choose, and cd into, a convenient directory for the package.

       2. `tar -xvzf crotalus-0.94.tar.gz', or for those of you with an
          archaic (non-GNU) tar; `gzip -cd crotalus-0.94.tar.gz | tar
          -xvf -'

       3. Read the documentation.  Really.


  2. Build
       1. (optional) Change the default SERVER_ROOT by setting the
          #define     at the top of src/defines.h

       2. Type `./configure'

       3. If the configure step was successful, type `make'

       4. Report any errors to the maintainers for resolution, or strike
             out on your own.


  3. Configure
       1. Choose a server root. For a standard installation,
          /etc/crotalus     is often used.

       2. Locate the sample configuration file in
          _examples/crotalus.conf_,     and copy it to the server root
          (/etc/crotalus/crotalus.conf)

       3. Choose a user and server port under which Crotalus (Boa) can
          run.  The     traditional port is 80, and user nobody (create
          if     you need to) is often a good selection for security
          purposes.      If you don't have (or choose not to use) root
          privileges, you     can not use port numbers less than 1024,
          nor can you switch user id.

       4. Choose locations for log files, CGI programs (if any), and
          the base of your URL tree. Make sure to create any leading
          directories.      If you use the ones provided by the, make
          sure to create /var/log/crotalus/

       5. Set the location of the mime.types file.

       6. Edit _crotalus.conf_ according to your     choices above
          (this file documents itself).  Read through this file     to
          see what other features you can configure.


  4. Start
        * Start Crotalus (Boa).  If you didn't build the right
          SERVER_ROOT into the     binary, you can specify it on the
          command line with the -c option     (command line takes
          precedence).
                               Example: ./crotalus -c /usr/local/crotalus


  5. Test
        * At this point the server should run and serve documents.
          If not, check the error_log file for clues.

  6. Install
        * Copy the binary to a safe place, and put the invocation into
            your system startup scripts.  Use the same -c option you
          used     in your initial tests.

2.2 Files Used by Crotalus (Boa)
================================

`crotalus.conf'
       This file is the sole configuration file for Crotalus (Boa). The
     directives in this   file are defined in the DIRECTIVES section.

`mime.types'
       The MimeTypes <filename> defines what Content-Type Crotalus
     (Boa) will   send in an HTTP/1.0 or better transaction.    Set to
     /dev/null if you do not want to load a mime types file.    Do
     *not* comment out (better use AddType!)

2.3 Compile-Time and Command-Line Options
=========================================

SERVER_ROOT
-C
      The default server root as #defined by SERVER_ROOT in
     `defines.h' can be overridden on the command line using the  `-c'
     option.  The server root must hold your local copy of the
     configuration file `crotalus.conf'.
            Example: /usr/sbin/crotalus -c /etc/crotalus



File: crotalus.info,  Node: crotalus.conf Directives,  Next: Security,  Prev: Compile-Time and Command-Line Options,  Up: (top)

2.4 crotalus.conf Directives
============================

The Crotalus (Boa) configuration file is parsed with a custom parser.
If it reports an error, the line number will be provided; it should be
easy to spot. The syntax of each of these rules is very simple, and they
can occur in any order. Where possible, these directives mimic those of
NCSA httpd 1.3; I (Paul Phillips) saw no reason to introduce gratuitous
differences.

Note: the "ServerRoot" is not in this configuration file. It can be
compiled into the server (see `defines.h') or specified on the command
line with the `-c' option.

The following directives are contained in the `crotalus.conf' file, and
most, but not all, are required.

`Port <Integer>'
       This is the port that Crotalus (Boa) runs on. The default port
     for http servers is 80.    If it is less than 1024, the server
     must be started as root.

`Listen <IP>'
       The Internet address to bind(2) to, in quadded-octet form
     (numbers).    If you leave it out, it binds to all addresses
     (INADDR_ANY).

       The name you provide gets run through inet_aton(3), so you have
     to   use dotted  quad notation.  This configuration is too
     important to trust some DNS.

       You only get one "Listen" directive,  if you want service on
     multiple   IP addresses, you have three choices:

       1. Run crotalus without a "Listen" directive:
             * All addresses are treated the same; makes sense if the
               addresses      are localhost, ppp, and eth0.

             * Use the VirtualHost directive below to point requests to
               different files.       Should be good for a very large
               number of addresses (web hosting clients).


       2. Run one copy of crotalus per IP address:
             * Each instance has its own configuration with its own
               "Listen" directive.  No big deal up to a few tens of
               addresses. Nice separation      between clients.


`BackLog <integer>'
      BackLog sets the value sent to listen(2).   The default value is
     whatever SO_MAXCONN is defined to.

`User <username or UID>'
      The name or UID the server should run as. For Crotalus (Boa) to
     attempt this, the  server must be started as root.

`Group <groupname or GID>'
      The group name or GID the server should run as. For Crotalus
     (Boa) to attempt this,  the server must be started as root.

`ServerAdmin <email address>'
      The email address where server problems should be sent. Note:
     this is not  currently used.

`ServerRoot <root>'
      This parameter is analogous to the '-c' command line option - it
     sets  a default server root. The server root is where Crotalus
     (Boa) expects to find  crotalus.conf, and from which all relative
     alias paths are constructed.

`UseLocaltime'
      Tell Crotalus (Boa) to output time in the local time zone instead
     of GMT (UTC).

`ErrorLog <filename>'
      The location of the error log file. If this does not start with
     /, it is  considered relative to the server root. Set to /dev/null
     if you don't want  errors logged.

`AccessLog <filename>'
      The location of the access log file. If this does not start with
     /, it is  considered relative to the server root. Comment out or
     set to /dev/null  (less effective) to disable access logging.

`CGILog <filename>'
      The location of the CGI error log file.  If this does not start
     with /, it  is considered relative to the server root. If
     specified, this is the file  that the stderr of CGIs is tied to,
     *instead* of to the ErrorLog.

`VerboseCGILogs'
      This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters.
     Comment out to  disable. All it does is switch on or off logging
     of when CGIs are launched and when  the children return.

`ServerName <server_name>'
      The name of this server that should be sent back to clients if
     different  than that returned by gethostname.

`VirtualHost'
      This is a logical switch and does not take any parameters.
     Comment out to disable. Given  DocumentRoot /var/www, requests on
     interface `A' or  IP `IP-A' become /var/www/IP-A. Example:
     http://localhost/ becomes  /var/www/127.0.0.1

`VHostRoot <directory>'
      The root location for all virtually hosted data.   Comment out to
     disable.   Incompatible with 'Virtualhost' and 'DocumentRoot'!!
     Given VHostRoot /var/www, requests to host foo.bar.com,  where
     foo.bar.com is ip a.b.c.d,  become /var/www/a.b.c.d/foo.bar.com
     Hostnames are "cleaned", and must conform to the rules  specified
     in rfc1034, which are be summarized here:

      Hostnames must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit,
     and have as interior characters only letters, digits, and hyphen.
     Hostnames must not exceed 63 characters in length.

`DefaultVHost <hostname>'
      Define this in order to have a default hostname when the client
     does not  specify one, if using VirtualHostName. If not specified,
     the word  "default" will be used for compatibility with older
     clients.

`DocumentRoot <directory>'
      The root directory of the HTML documents. If this does not start
     with /,  it is considered relative to the server root.

`UserDir <directory>'
      The name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home
     directory  if a ~user request is received.

`DirectoryIndex <filename>'
      Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML directory index.
     Please  make and use these files. On the fly creation of directory
     indexes  can be slow.

`DirectoryMaker <full pathname to program>'
      Name of the program used  to generate on-the-fly directory
     listings.  The program must take one or two  command-line
     arguments, the first being the directory to index (absolute), and
     the  second, which is  optional, should be the "title" of the
     document be. Comment out if  you don't  want on the fly directory
     listings. If this  does not start with /, it is  considered
     relative to the server root.

`DirectoryCache <directory>'
      DirectoryCache: If DirectoryIndex doesn't exist, and
     DirectoryMaker has been  commented out, the the on-the-fly
     indexing of Crotalus (Boa) can be used  to generate indexes  of
     directories. Be warned that the output is extremely minimal and
     can cause  delays when slow disks are used.  Note: The
     DirectoryCache must be writable by the  same user/group that
     Crotalus (Boa) runs as.

`PidFile <filename>'
      Where to put the pid of the process.   Comment out to write no
     pid file.   Note: Because Crotalus (Boa) drops privileges at
     startup, and the  pid file is written by the UID/GID before doing
     so, Crotalus (Boa)  does not attempt removal of the pid file.

`KeepAliveMax <integer>'
      Number of KeepAlive requests to allow per connection. Comment
     out, or set  to 0 to disable keepalive processing.

`KeepAliveTimeout <integer>'
      Number of seconds to wait before keepalive connections time out.

`MimeTypes <file>'
      The location of the mime.types file. If this does not start with
     /, it is  considered relative to the server root.   Comment out to
     avoid loading mime.types (better use AddType!)

`DefaultType <mime type>'
      MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there is no
     file  extension.

`DefaultCharset <default charset>'
      If set, the default character set will be appended to the
     Content-Type for all 'text' mime types.

`AddType <mime type> <extension> extension...'
      Associates a MIME type  with an extension or extensions.

`Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias'
      Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -
     they match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action.
     Use Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and
     ScriptAlias to enable directories for script execution.

`Redirect <path1> <path2>'
       allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist
     in your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you
     tell the clients where to look for the relocated document.

`Alias <path1> <path2>'
       aliases one path to another. Of course, symbolic links in the
     file system work fine too.

`ScriptAlias <path1> <path2>'
       maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts.

`SinglePostLimit <integer>'
      If defined, the maximum number of bytes that a client may send
     in a POST request. The default is 1024*1024 bytes, or 1 megabyte.

`CGIPath <string>'
      CGIPath sets the string that is used for the 'PATH' environment
     variable for CGIs.  The default is defined in defines.h.

`CGIumask <umask>'
      The CGIumask is set immediately before execution of the CGI.
     The default value is 027. The number must be interpretable
     unambiguously by the C function strtol. No base is specified,  so
     one may use a hexadecimal, decimal, or octal number if  it is
     prefixed accordingly.

`MaxConnections <integer>'
      MaxConnections defines the maximum number of concurrent
     connections  that Crotalus (Boa) will handle.  Once Crotalus (Boa)
     reaches this limit, it stops  accepting connections until the
     number of active connections goes  down. The default is the
     maximum number of available file descriptors.

`Allow, Deny'
      Only supported if Crotalus (Boa) is compiled with
     -enable-access-control.   Allow and Deny allows pattern based
     access control using shell  wildcards. The string the matching is
     performed on is the absolute  filesystem filename. The Allow, Deny
     directives are processed in  order until the first match is found,
     and are processed using fnmatch.

`Deny <pattern>'
       Disallow files matching <pattern>

`Allow <pattern>'
       Allow files matching <pattern>

2.5 Security
============

Crotalus (Boa) has been designed to use the existing file system
security.   In `crotalus.conf', the directives _user_ and _group_
determine who Crotalus (Boa) will run as, if launched by root.  By
default, the user/group is nobody/nogroup.  This allows quite a bit of
flexibility.  For example, if you want to disallow access to otherwise
accessible directories or files, simply make them inaccessible to
nobody/nogroup. If the user that Crotalus (Boa) runs as is "crotalus"
and the groups that "crotalus" belongs to include "web-stuff" then
files/directories accessible by users with group "web-stuff" will also
be accessible to Crotalus (Boa).

The February 2000 hoo-rah from CERT advisory CA-2000-02
(http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) has little to do with
Crotalus (Boa).  As of version 0.94.4, Crotalus (Boa)'s escaping rules
have been cleaned up a little, but they weren't that bad before.  The
example CGI programs have been updated to show what effort is needed
there.  If you write, maintain, or use CGI programs under Crotalus
(Boa) (or any other server) it's worth your while to read and
understand this advisory.  The real problem, however, boils down to
browser and web page designers emphasizing frills over content and
security.  The market leading browsers assume (incorrectly) that all
web pages are trustworthy.

3 Limits and Design Philosophy
******************************

There are many issues that become more difficult to resolve in a single
tasking web server than in the normal forking model.  Here is a partial
list - there are probably others that haven't been encountered yet.

* Menu:

* Limits::
* Differences between Crotalus (Boa) and other web servers::
* Unexpected Behavior::


File: crotalus.info,  Node: Limits,  Next: Differences between Crotalus (Boa) and other web servers,  Up: Limits and Design Philosophy

3.1 Limits
==========

   * Slow file systems

      The file systems being served should be much faster than the
     network connection to the HTTP requests, or performance will
     suffer.   For instance, if a document is served from a CD-ROM, the
     whole server  (including all other currently incomplete data
     transfers) will stall  while the CD-ROM spins up.  This is a
     consequence of the fact that Crotalus (Boa)  mmap()'s each file
     being served, and lets the kernel read and cache  pages as best it
     knows how.  When the files come from a local disk  (the faster the
     better), this is no problem, and in fact delivers  nearly ideal
     performance under heavy load.  Avoid serving documents  from NFS
     and CD-ROM unless you have even slower inbound net  connections
     (e.g., POTS SLIP).

   * DNS lookups

      Writing a nonblocking gethostbyaddr is a difficult and not very
     enjoyable task.  Paul Phillips experimented with several methods,
     including a separate logging process, before removing hostname
     lookups entirely. There is a companion program with Crotalus (Boa)
     `util/resolver.pl' that will postprocess the logfiles and  replace
     IP addresses with hostnames, which is much faster no matter  what
     sort of server you run.

   * Identd lookups

      Same difficulties as hostname lookups; not included.   Crotalus
     (Boa) provides a REMOTE_PORT environment variable, in addition  to
     REMOTE_ADDR, so that a CGI program can do its own ident.   See the
     end of examples/cgi-test.cgi.

   * Password file lookups via NIS

      If users are allowed to serve HTML from their home directories,
     password file lookups can potentially block the process.  To lessen
     the impact, each user's home directory is cached by Crotalus (Boa)
     so it need  only be looked up once.

   * Running out of file descriptors

      Since a file descriptor is needed for every ongoing connection
     (two for non-nph CGIs, directories, and automatic gunzipping of
     files),  it is possible though highly improbable to run out of file
     descriptors.  The symptoms of this conditions may vary with  your
     particular Unix variant, but you will probably see log  entries
     giving an error message for accept.   Try to build your kernel to
     give an adequate number for  your usage - GNU/Linux provides 256
     out of the box, more than  enough for most people.

3.2 Differences between Crotalus (Boa) and other web servers
============================================================

In the pursuit of speed and simplicity, some aspects of Crotalus (Boa)
differ from the popular web servers.  In no particular order:

   * REMOTE_HOST environment variable not set for CGI programs

       The REMOTE_HOST environment variable is not set for CGI programs,
      for reasons already described.  This is easily worked around
     because the   IP address is provided in the REMOTE_ADDR variable,
     so (if the CGI   program actually cares) gethostbyaddr or a
     variant can be used.

   * There are no server side includes (SSI) in Crotalus (Boa)

       We don't like them, and they are too slow to parse.  We will
     consider   more efficient alternatives.

   * There are no access control features

       Crotalus (Boa) will follow symbolic links, and serve any file
     that it can   read.  The expectation is that you will configure
     Crotalus (Boa) to run as user   "nobody", and only files
     configured world readable will come   out.    If Crotalus (Boa) is
     compiled with -enable-access-control, access control is
     supported using the Allow, Deny directives.

   * No chroot option

       There is no option to run chrooted.  If anybody wants this, and
     is   willing to try out experimental code, contact the maintainers.


File: crotalus.info,  Node: Unexpected Behavior,  Prev: Differences between Crotalus (Boa) and other web servers,  Up: Limits and Design Philosophy

3.3 Unexpected Behavior
=======================

   * SIGHUP handling

      Like any good server, Crotalus (Boa) traps SIGHUP and rereads
     `crotalus.conf'.   However, under normal circumstances, it has
     already given away  permissions, so many items listed in
     `crotalus.conf' can not take effect.   No attempt is made to
     change uid, gid, log files, or server port.   All other
     configuration changes should take place smoothly.

   * Relative URL handling

      Not all browsers handle relative URLs correctly.  Crotalus (Boa)
     will not  cover up for this browser bug, and will typically report
     404 Not Found  for URL's containing odd combinations of "../" 's.

      Note: As of version 0.95.0 (unreleased) the URL parser has been
     rewritten and *does* correctly handle relative URLs.

A.2 Acknowledgments
===================

Paul Phillips wrote the first versions of Crotalus (Boa), up to and
including version 0.91.  Version 0.92 of Crotalus (Boa) was officially
released December 1996 by Larry Doolittle.  Version 0.93 was the
development version of 0.94, which was released in February 2000.

The Crotalus (Boa) Webserver is currently (Feb 2000) maintained and
enhanced by Larry Doolittle (<ldoolitt@crotalus.org>) and Jon Nelson
(<jnelson@crotalus.org>).

We would like to thank Russ Nelson (<nelson@crynwr.com>) for hosting
the web site (http://www.crotalus.org/).

We would also like to thank Paul Phillips for writing code that is
worth maintaining and supporting.

Many people have contributed to Crotalus (Boa), but instead of listing
them here, their names and specific contributions have been listed in
the `CREDITS' file.

Paul Phillips records his acknowledgments as follows:

     Thanks to everyone in the WWW community, in general a great bunch
     of people.  Special thanks to Clem Taylor
     (<<ctaylor@eecis.udel.edu>>), who provided invaluable feedback on
     many of my ideas, and offered good ones of his own.  Also thanks
     to John Franks, author of wn, for writing what I believe is the
     best webserver out there.

A.4 Other HTTP Servers
======================

For Unix-alike platforms, with published source code.

   * tiny/turbo/throttling httpd very similar to Crotalus (Boa), with a
     throttling  feature
       `http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/'

   * Roxen: based on ulpc interpreter, non-forking (interpreter
     implements  threading), GPL'd
       `http://www.roxen.com/'

   * WN: featureful, GPL'd
       `http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/'

   * Apache: fast, PD
       `http://www.apache.org/'

   * NCSA: standard, legal status?
       `http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/'

   * CERN: standard, PD, supports proxy
       `http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/Status.html'

   * xs-httpd 2.0: small, fast, pseudo-GPL'd
       `http://www.stack.nl/~sven/xs-httpd/'

   * bozohttpd.tar.gz sources, in perl
       `ftp://ftp.eterna.com.au/bozo/bsf/attware/bozohttpd.tar.gz'

   * Squid is actually an "Internet Object Cache"
       `http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/'

Also worth mentioning is Zeus.  It is commercial, with a free demo, so
it doesn't belong on the list above.  Zeus seems to be based on
technology similar to Crotalus (Boa) and thttpd, but with more bells
and whistles.
